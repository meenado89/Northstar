# Northstar Core

Northstar Core is a personal desktop assistant designed to help with everyday
computer tasks, organization, and project support.

It lives on the desktop as a lightweight companion and provides assistance
through text (and later voice), similar to a digital butler.

Northstar is intended to run locally, prioritize user control, and gradually
gain automation capabilities.

# Scope
Northstar is not a general AI or autonomous decision-maker.

information, and system-level tasks.
